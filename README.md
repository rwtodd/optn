# optn

A cmdline program to calculate options returns.  I have similar powershell scripts,
but this was just an excuse to get more familiar with using the swift language, and
test out the `ArgParser` library I wrote.

## Usage

I don't really want people depending on this program for investment advise... it's just
a personal utility I use.  Still... the commands offer --help and it should be easy
to figure out what it's doing

commands:

 - cc covered call returns
 - sp short put returns
