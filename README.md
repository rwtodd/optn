# optn

A cmdline program to calculate options returns.  I have similar powershell scripts.
I wrote this in swift first, to get more familiar with it (and exercise the `ArgParser`
library I had written), but now I've rewritten it in java.  The swift version is still
in the repository history, if you are interested.

## Usage

I don't really want people depending on this program for investment advice... it's just
a personal utility I use.  Still... the commands offer --help and it should be easy
to figure out what it's doing

commands:

 - cc covered call returns
 - sp short put returns
